# 29. Interactive Debugging

**Core Principle:** Writing complex prompts and pipelines can be difficult. Developers need tools to debug them, just like with traditional code. ProML should support interactive debugging, including features like breakpoints and step-through execution.

This principle elevates prompt engineering from a "black box" guessing game to a transparent, inspectable process.

## Why it Matters

*   **Transparency:** Debugging allows a developer to see the *exact* state of a prompt or pipeline at any point in its execution. What were the variable values? What was the raw output from the model before it was parsed?
*   **Faster Development:** Instead of relying on `print` statements and trial-and-error, a developer can quickly pinpoint the exact step where a pipeline is failing or producing an incorrect result.
*   **Understanding Complex Logic:** For long and complex pipelines, a debugger is essential for understanding how data flows between steps and how intermediate results influence the final output.
*   **Improved Reliability:** A good debugging experience leads to more robust and well-tested prompts, as developers can more easily find and fix edge cases.

## Practical Application & Examples

Interactive debugging would be a feature of a **ProML IDE** or a specialized development tool. A developer could set breakpoints within a prompt file and then run it in a "debug mode".

### Example: Debugging a Pipeline

Imagine a developer is debugging the `Reflect-and-Revise` pipeline from the [Pipelines & Steps](./pipelines_steps.md) documentation. The final output is poor, and they want to see why.

**File: `/prompts/reflect_and_revise.proml`**
```
PROMPT:
PIPELINE:
  - name: "draft_summary"
    prompt: "/prompts/basic_summarizer.proml"
    input: { article: "{{INPUT.article}}" }

  - name: "critique_summary" Breakpoint
    prompt: "/prompts/summary_critic.proml"
    input: {
      summary: "{{STEPS.draft_summary.output.summary}}",
      article: "{{INPUT.article}}"
    }

  - name: "revise_summary"
    prompt: "/prompts/summary_reviser.proml"
    input: {
      original_summary: "{{STEPS.draft_summary.output.summary}}",
      critique: "{{STEPS.critique_summary.output.critique}}",
      article: "{{INPUT.article}}"
    }
```

**The Debugging Process:**

1.  **Set Breakpoint:** The developer adds a `Breakpoint` keyword (or clicks in the gutter of their IDE) on the `critique_summary` step.
2.  **Run in Debug Mode:** They start the execution in their IDE.
3.  **Execution Pauses:** The pipeline runs the `draft_summary` step and then pauses *before* executing `critique_summary`.
4.  **Inspect State:** The IDE now shows a debug panel with the current state of the pipeline:

    ```json
    {
      "INPUT": {
        "article": "... (full article text) ..."
      },
      "STEPS": {
        "draft_summary": {
          "status": "completed",
          "output": {
            "summary": "The article discusses new tech laws. It will require companies to disclose data policies and may face challenges."
          },
          "metrics": {
            "latency_ms": 1200,
            "cost_usd": 0.0015
          }
        }
      }
    }
    ```

5.  **Identify the Problem:** The developer inspects the `draft_summary.output.summary`. They realize the draft is too simplistic and is missing key details. The problem isn't in the `critique` or `revise` step; the initial draft is the source of the error.

6.  **Step Through (or Stop):** From here, the developer could:
    *   **Step Over:** Execute the `critique_summary` step and pause again before `revise_summary` to see what the critique looks like.
    *   **Modify Variables:** They could even manually edit the `draft_summary.output.summary` in the debugger to see how the rest of the pipeline would behave with a better draft.
    *   **Stop:** Stop the execution and go fix the `basic_summarizer.proml` to produce more detailed drafts.

By providing a familiar debugging experience, ProML would make prompt engineering significantly more productive and accessible to the millions of developers who already rely on these tools for writing traditional code.
